  <p>The Best Burger Recipe is grilled, juicy, and slathered in secret sauce. These homemade burgers will make you never want summer to end!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 lbs. Laura's Lean Ground Beef</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Gourmet Burger Seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup BBQ sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>1/4 cup dill pickles finely diced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dill pickle juice</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>sliced cheddar cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, stir Laura's Lean Ground Beef, burger seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and BBQ sauce together until well combined and evenly mixed.</li>
    <li>Line a 4-inch wide lid with plastic wrap. Add a few spoonfuls of hamburger mixture to the lid and fold plastic wrap over the top to press and mold the burger patty. Unwrap from plastic wrap and place onto a plate or platter. Continue this process until you have created 8 patties, about 1/4 pound each, 1/3-1/2 inch thick, 4 inches across.</li>
    <li>Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour. (This will help the burgers keep their shape on the grill)</li>
    <li>While burgers are resting, make the secret sauce: stir mayonnaise together with ketchup, pickles, pickle juice, ground pepper, and garlic powder. Place in refrigerator.</li>
    <li>Also, prep your burger toppings: slice tomatoes, wash and tear lettuce, slice the onion, etc.</li>
    <li>To grill, place each burger onto preheated grill. Cook 3 minutes on one side and then flip. Add cheddar cheese slices on each patty, cover and cook 1 minute. Turn grill off and then continue cooking another 3 minutes or until burgers register 160 degrees F.</li>
  </ol>
